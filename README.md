We've built a bot that you can integrate into customer service live chat as well as ticketing systems like Zendesk which can help you do two things:

1. It can analyze chats between customers and customer service representatives, store earlier solutions and swoop into the conversation
if a customer comes up with the same problem again, so the customer service agents don't have to repeat a solution they have already provided

**Example:**

>🙍🏻‍♂️: Hi, I am unable to login
>👩🏻‍💼:Customer Service: Please activate your account

>🙍🏻‍♂️: Hi, I am unable to login
>🤖: Please try activating your account

2. Many times a particular type of ticket keeps coming up again and again which CS has to forward to a particular department (say tech). It can be due to a
known bug or something else. In this case, our service will analyze and group similar tickets and can be integrated into ticketing systems like Zendesk
further allowing the tickets to automatically be grouped and sent to the respective departments

**Example:**

>🙍🏻‍♂️: Please Resend my invoice
>👩🏻‍💼: Alright sending your request to the accounts department

>🙍🏻‍♂️: Please Resend my invoice
>TicketsAI(🤖): Looks like an invoice problem we need to send this to the accounts department.
